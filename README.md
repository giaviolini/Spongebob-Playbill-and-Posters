# Spongebob Playbill and Posters

As the Graphic and Playbill designer for Downingtown East Theatre Department's 2023 production of 'Spongebob the Musical', I had full creative freedom in the design and artwork, as long as I included my Spongebob Logo. I wanted to create a design that was not too busy. I of course took inspiration from the animations. You can see the flowers and the jellyfish used in the background art are both from the Spongebob cartoon. I created these drawings freehand in Photoshop on a Lenovo laptop.

This was a very long process to create the Playbill, Posters, Logos, and other graphics for print and digital media. It was a very challenging but fun experience with lots of moving parts. I handled all production including:
1. Establishing the production timelines for all printed items.
2. Working with advertisers to provide correctly formatted art for Playbill ads.
3. Getting photos and bios of all the actors for publication in the Playbill.
4. Designing and producing all artwork for final printing using Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Acrobat, and Canva.
5. Working with local vendors to print the final files and arrange for delivery in time for performances.
