# Spongebob Playbill and Posters

For my school's production of Spongebob the Musical. I had full creative freedom, as long as I included my Spongebob Logo, and I wanted something not to busy. I of course took inspiration from the animations. You can see the flowers and the jellyfish are both from the Spongebob cartoon. 

This was a very long process to create the Playbill, Posters, logos, and any other publication graphics we needed. It was a very challenging, but fun, experinece, and I am doing it again this year for both the fall play and spring musical this year.
